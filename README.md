# Loop1000

You are asked to print out all the numbers f rom 1 to 1000. Write 2 lines of
code in your ﬁle to print out all numbers f rom 1 to 1000.

Once you've got this to work, add logic inside your loop to only print out
the numbers f rom 1 to 1000 that are even (i.e. divisible by 2). Remember
the modulo command — i.e., %. 10%5 will give you the remainder of 10
divided by 5. 10 divided by 5 equals 2 with a remainder of 0. Hence, this
statement returns 0. Any even number is a number that can be divided by
2 with no remainder.
